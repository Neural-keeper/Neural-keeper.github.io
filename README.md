# Well, Hello There!
Was that too reminiscent of the default first line of code every coder writes, a rite of initiation? Or am I looking too deep into things.
# Where Am I?
That's an odd question to ask, considering you're already here, but I might as well indulge. _Welcome,_ dear reader, to the world of **Sahasra Kondapalli**.
Do you like it here? You should stay a while. Partake in a tea party, perhaps? Indulge in a game of lopsided chess? No? A shame.
>All great things have humble beginnings.>
Amd here, I document mine. Brace yourself, this is a rare oppurtunity to get a taste of the madness in my mind, or the genius therein. Perhaps this will take you on a detour through paths and forests, flowers you never thought you'd see, prose beyond the scope of your imagination. Or perhaps you'll stray too far and encounter a big bad wolf. Stay on the path this time?
Well then, I suppose it's time for you to be off. What will you discover about me, my hobbies, my likes, my dislikes? Will you, oh adventerous soul, find that which you're looking for, or will you find more than you bargained for? Seeing as you read this till here, I believe you just might find something even I was unaware of.
