      <p>I'm <i>technically</i> an amateur programmer but this will be where I 
      document everything I do. I'm currently a Computer Science Freshman
      at USF. You'll see me on github, but doing nothing (I will do something).
      My current project is called MOIRA, a Pokemon style adventure game
      based on Greek gods, where you get to be a greek god and restore
      Olympus or choose to remake it.</p>

          A decision based adventure game that follows the Greek gods as
          they work on rebuilding their places of power after the 
          collapse of Olympus. Was it intentional? In any case, the
          gods can't do much until they've restored their seats of
          power.
